# ESP32 Accident Detection System

## 📖 Project Overview
This project presents an IoT-based accident detection system using ESP32, MPU6050 accelerometer, and GPS module.

The system continuously monitors vehicle motion and detects sudden changes in acceleration that may indicate an accident.

When an accident is detected, the ESP32 retrieves real-time GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) and displays them through the Serial Monitor. The system can be extended for real-time emergency alert applications.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect vehicle accidents automatically
- Obtain real-time GPS location
- Reduce emergency response time

---

## 🛠 Components Used
- ESP32
- MPU6050 (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)
- GPS Module
- Power Supply

---

## ⚙ Working Principle
1. MPU6050 monitors acceleration values.
2. If acceleration exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2.5g), accident is detected.
3. GPS module fetches location.
4. Location is displayed on Serial Monitor.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add GSM for SMS alerts
- Cloud integration
- Mobile application support
